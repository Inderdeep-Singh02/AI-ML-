# AI-ML-
This repository contains a collection of AI/ML projects that I have developed using Google Colab. These projects cover various concepts in machine learning 

Libraries Used
The projects in this repository heavily utilize the following libraries:

NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Pandas: A versatile library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures such as dataframes to efficiently handle structured data, making it easier to clean, transform, and explore datasets.

Matplotlib: A popular plotting library in Python that allows the creation of static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It provides a wide range of customizable plots and charts to represent data in a visually appealing manner.

Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It simplifies the creation of complex visualizations and offers additional features like color palettes, statistical estimation, and multi-plot grids.

Scikit-Learn: A robust machine learning library that provides a comprehensive set of tools for various tasks such as data preprocessing, feature selection, model evaluation, and more. It includes a wide range of algorithms and utilities for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework that facilitates the development and deployment of deep learning models. It provides a high-level API for building neural networks, along with powerful tools for model training, evaluation, and inference.

Dataset Sources
The datasets used in these projects are sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/). Kaggle is a popular platform that hosts a wide range of datasets contributed by the community, making it a valuable resource for data-driven projects.
